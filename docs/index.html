            <h2 id="chapter1">Where Are Guitar Notes In Sheet Music?</h2>
            <p>First we'll break down the names of guitar notes, then we'll see where each note is on a sheet of music.</p>

            <h2 id="chapter2">What Are Keys And Time Signatures?</h2>
            <p>In this section, we'll go over keys in music (and how they're easy to transpose to different keys) and time signatures (with some example songs in their signature). </p>

            <h2 id="chapter3">How Do Scales Work?</h2>
            <p>I'm sure you know that minor and major scales sound different, but why is that and how do the minor and major scales relate? You'll also learn about two other minor scales (which can have a nice sound) and you'll be briefed on what modes are (even though, if you're not too deep into music theory, they're not wildly important).</p>

            <h2 id="chapter4">How Are Chords Constructed?</h2>
            <p>Here, you'll learn what makes up a chord, how you can voice your chords, and you'll learn about the different symbols on music sheets that specify what chord to play.</p>

            <h2 id="chapter5">How Do I Come Up With Melodies?</h2>
            <p>Let's apply what we've learned to make a quick song.</p>
