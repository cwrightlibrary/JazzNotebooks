            <h2>Staff 101</h2>
            <p>Before we get into keys and time signatures, let's quickly go over the basics of a staff.</p>

            <p>The first thing you'll see on a staff (in blue) is the <strong>Clef</strong>. This is the tuning for your instrument, usually you'll just see the Treble clef, like in the example. Next, you'll see the <strong>Key Signature</strong> (in red); if there isn't a marking for the key, it means you don't play any notes sharp or flat, the key of C. Lastly is the <strong>Time Signature</strong> (in green).</p>

            <h2>Key Signatures</h2>

            <p>I won't go more into the clef right now because you'll basically only be seeing the Treble clef. Instead, let's go right into how Key Signatures work.</p>

            <p>Key Signatures just tell you to play certain notes flat or sharp unless otherwise marked by a natural (♮) within the staff. Look at the example below, we begin in the key of C (because there is no Key Signature showing). If we play up the scale of C, we can play a C Major chord and everything sounds good.</p> 
            
            <p>But what if we wanted to play a C Minor chord? We could mark each note we want to play as flat, but we'd have to do it for every note in the song. Instead we can just put in the Key Signature for E♭ and write the same notes, which is much quicker to notate.</p>

            <h2>Time Signatures</h2>
            <p>Next, let's take a look at <strong>Time Signatures</strong>. I'm sure you can tell what the Time Signature by counting "1-2-3-4" over a song. The top 4 represents how many notes in a measure; the bottom 4 represents the length of the note to count (4 is a quarter note, one quarter of a whole note which would be the whole measure).</p>

            <p>So you can count "1-2-3-4, 1-2-3-4, etc." over the first two measures...</p>

            <p>"1-2-3, 1-2-3, etc." over the next two measures...</p>

            <p>And finally, "1-2-3-4-5, 1-2-3-4-5, etc." over the last two.</p>

            <iframe width="100%" height="460" src="https://musescore.com/user/83052286/scores/20194030/embed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allow="autoplay; fullscreen"></iframe>

            <p>Hopefully, this makes sense to you. Most songs are in 4/4 time, so that should come easily to you. You can usually tell when a song is in 3/4 time, also known as a waltz. There are some more bizarre Time Signatures that are less common, like the 5/4 time (Take Five is a good example of 5/4 time).</p>

            <p>Next, let's take a look at scales: the Major Scale and the three Minor Scales.</p>
